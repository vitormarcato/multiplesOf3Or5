# Multiple of 3 or 5

A code challenge to practice 

### Problem
---

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

### Why
---

The project purpose is to practice, study and improve knowledge about programming.
